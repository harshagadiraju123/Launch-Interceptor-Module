# Launch-Interceptor-Module
The Launch interceptor program is implemented in C using Beagle Bone Black. The launch interceptor module will generate a signal 
whether an interceptor should be launched based upon input radar tracking information. The signal is generated when several 
possible Launch interceptor conditions are met. The conditions are given in the project description.pdf
